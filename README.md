# React training : Steam

Quick training to get me into React again using **React 15.1**, **Webpack** (with hot reload module) and **NodeJS + Express** which is simply serving the html index.

You need **Nodemon** (`npm i -g nodemon`)

Gets current Steam offers from Steam API.

Run `npm run serve` to run the NodeJS server and enable webpack hot reload.
